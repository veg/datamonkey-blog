Effective immediately, and reflecting recent improvements in both architecture
and HyPhy software improvements, datamonkey.org has been updated with new
maximum sequence and site limits. Please see for details. 

All site models, such as FEL, have increased sequence maximum limits from 500 to
5000, site maximum limits have increased from 12000 to 32000. FUBAR's maximum
sequence limit has been increased to 10000.

Branch-site models BUSTED and aBSREL have increased from 500 to 1000.
